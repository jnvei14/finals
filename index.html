        <h1>Basic Concepts of Probability and statistics</h1>
        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Probability</h2>
            <p><strong> is the study of uncertainty, and it helps us predict how likely an event is to occur. It ranges from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event). </strong> For example, if you draw a card from a standard 52-card deck, the probability of drawing an Ace is 
                4
                /
                52
                4/52, because there are 4 Aces out of 52 cards. Probability applies to daily life, such as weather forecasts, where a 70% chance of rain means rain is likely but not guaranteed. It’s used extensively in games, statistics, and decision-making.
                </p>
                <p><strong> Formula:</strong></p>
                <p>P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Permutation</h2>
            <p><strong> permutation considers the arrangement of items where the order is important. </strong> For example, if you are arranging 3 students, Anna, Ben, and Clara, the order Anna-Ben-Clara is different from Clara-Ben-Anna. The formula for permutations is:</p>
            <p>P(n,r) = n! / ( n - r ) !</p>
            <p>This concept is used in areas like seating arrangements, password generation, and scheduling tasks. Permutations help when the sequence of items impacts the outcome.

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Combination</h2>
            <p><strong>A combination is used when selecting items, and the order in which they are chosen does not matter. </strong> For example, imagine you are choosing 3 students from a group of 5 to form a team. Whether you pick Anna, Ben, and Clara or Clara, Anna, and Ben, the group is the same. The formula for combinations is:</p>
            <p>C(n,r) = n! / r! ( n - r ) !</p>
            <p>where 
                𝑛
                is the total number of items, 
                𝑟
                 is the number to be chosen, and 
                !
                ! means factorial. Combinations are used in fields like statistics, lottery systems, and organizing groups for events.
